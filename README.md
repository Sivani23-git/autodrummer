A browser-based real-time rhythm and tempo detection system that listens to microphone input, detects beats, estimates BPM, visualizes audio, and generates a synchronized drum rhythm using the Web Audio API.

🧠 What This Project Does:
🎙️ Captures live microphone audio
📊 Measures real-time volume (RMS)
🥁 Detects beats from audio peaks
⏱️ Calculates tempo (BPM)
🎶 Plays an auto-generated rhythm (Kick, Snare, Hi-Hat)
📈 Displays frequency bars & waveform visualization
🟢 Shows beat timing visually (1-2-3-4)

✨ Key Features:
Real-time BPM Detection
Automatic Rhythm Generation
Live Audio Visualization
Interactive UI with Animations
Debug Console for Audio Events
Fully Client-Side (No Backend Needed)

🛠️ Technologies Used:
HTML5
CSS3 (Animations & Gradients)
JavaScript (ES6)
Web Audio API
Canvas API

⚠️ Browser Requirements:
Microphone permission required
HTTPS recommended (for GitHub Pages)

Works best in:
✅ Chrome
✅ Edge
✅ Firefox

🧪 Known Limitations:
Basic beat detection (not ML-based)
Works best with clear rhythmic sounds
Not optimized for complex music

🔮 Future Enhancements:
🎼 Time-signature detection
🤖 ML-based beat tracking
🎧 Instrument selection
💾 Export detected BPM
📱 Mobile UI optimization
